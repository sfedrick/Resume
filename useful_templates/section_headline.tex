I am a physics major at Haverford college. I finish my undergraduate degree December 2020, but I am currently enrolled in the 4+1 program at my college. This program allows me to complete my four years at Haverford, and I attend the University of Pennsylvania for 1 year. At the end of my 5 years, I will have a Bachelors of Physics and a Masters of Mechanical Engineering. I will finish the program December 2021. To accomplish this, I supplement my course load with various engineering classes at the University of Pennsylvania. This has allowed me to become familiar with the core of physics as well as various engineering technologies such as Solid Works and Ansys. Professionally, I have done research in fluid dynamics, investigating the effect of viscoelasticity on lubrication forces. I have also had various jobs that have involved an intense degree of coding this includes my time as a Digital Scholar; my time working for the City of Miami Fire Department; and to a lesser extent my time as a student worker for Haverford College's IT department.
