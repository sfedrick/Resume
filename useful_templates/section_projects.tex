	{Touch down of a Sphere in viscoelastic media}{2018 - 2020}
	{\website{https://rb.gy/2ko495}{Boger Fluids}  }
	{For my senior thesis at Haverford college, I analyzed the effects of elasticity on lubrication forces. This project required the analysis of fluid flows, image analysis, and rapid prototyping. I had to design and create various expiremental appratuses using a 3d printer, laser cutter, and machined parts. I then used Matlab and Java in combination with Fiji to analyze data from constant force measurements and video data.}
