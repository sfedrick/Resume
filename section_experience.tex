  {Jan 2022}      {Mechatronics Engineer |  Software Algorithms and Motion Control }{ASML}{Wilton,Ct}
  {current} {Currently, I work to implement robotic software onto a 6dof robotic reticle stage. This involves designing/implementing perception algorithms, simulating the dynamics of the stage, and designing/implementing other appropriate software algorithms to help control the robotic stage.
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Developed a computer vision algorithm that took 3d scans of moving wire ducts undergoing lifetime cycling and calculated the amount of wear the wires experienced from the scan movements. This algorithm was then utilized to create a predictive model for when ducts in the field will require replacement.
			\item Designed, developed, and tested  a software algorithm  that used numerical optimization techniques to optimize motor control 					parameters for reluctance actuators given robotic force data. Data was collected using a HIL (hardware in the loop) approach and analyzed in python. The software algorithm was implemented on the machine using a combination of Matlab and Python.
			\item Made a algorithm that processed video data of a robotic stage taking movement scans and extracted the shape of the moving wires on the platform to facilitate mechanical design optimization.
			\item Performed regression testing for new motor calibration software module, and wrote scripts to automate testing and analysis.
           		\item Created shell scripts to facilitate large scale automation of testing and experimentation on the robotic stage.	
		 	\end{itemize}

    {May 2021}     {GRASP Lab | Graduate Student Researcher (Robotics)  }{ University of Pennsylvania}{Pennsylvania}
    {Dec 2021}    {Designed and implemented a controller in C++ that ran on a micro controller in real time to add directionality to an origami robot.
                      \begin{itemize}
			\item Implemented a monte carlo algorithm in python to pick design parameters for an origami robot.
			\item Wrote a controller in C++ to control the latching mechanism that added directionality to the robot.

    {December 2018}   {Fluid dynamic research | Student Researcher}{Haverford College and University of Pennsylvania}{Pennsylvania}
    {May 2020} {
  I worked in collaboration with University of Pennsylvania and Haverford College to investigate the way Non-Newtonian effects impacted lubrication forces within a fluid.
                      \begin{itemize}
                         \item Used video processing and computer vision techniques to analyze and track the mechanics of a sphere moving through a fluid using OpenCV.
                         \item  Used Python to perform data analysis on real word data to determine the dynamics of a complex non-newtonian fluid system.
                      \end{itemize}

    {December 2016}   {Digital Scholarship | Website designer}{Haverford College}{Pennsylvania}
    {May 2019} {
    I worked on https://archivogam.haverford.edu/en/, a website designed to connect persons illegally detained and forcibly disappeared in Guatemala during the Civil War with friends and relatives.
                      \begin{itemize}
                       \item Wrote the front and back end of Home and Images Section of Archivo Gam using django.
