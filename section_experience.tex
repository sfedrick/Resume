                  Currently I work to implement robotic (Controls, Machine learning, Kinematics, and Computer vision) software and hardware changes onto a 6 dof, precision, robotic reticle stage. This involves writing software in matlab and python for a 6 dof robotic reticle stage to simulate the new feature. I then implement the function onto a fleet of stages within a cross sectoral team. 
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Developed a Slam algorithm to map disturbance at any given point within the Reticle stage's work space and then determine and predict necessary FF command given to the reticle stage based on that estimated location. Location was determined using differential sensors fused using a Kalman filter. Code was developed and written in a combination of Matlab and Python.
		\item Designed, developed, and tested  a software algorithm to optimize pretension values for pull only actuators and to optimize controller parameters using a MIL (machine in the loop) approach.
	\item Refactored a code base designed to simulate the dynamics of a 6 dof robotic reticle stage. Transfered this code base into a modern version control system (git) to aid software collaboration and tracking.
                       \item Created a motion planning application that utilized multithreading to position the 6 dof reticle stage into several desired positions  .
		    \item Lead the development of two new mechatronic tools that will enable automatic testing of electronics,hardware, and control methodologies of a 6 dof robotic reticle stage.
		 
		
 			\end{itemize}

    {May 2021}    {
 I used a phase change material coupled with a heated insert to create a latching mechanism to add directionality to an origami robot. I then designed and implemented a controller in C++ that ran on a micro controller in real time to control the mechanism .
                      \begin{itemize}
			\item Designed and optimized a nonlinear controller using Matlab and Python 
			\item Created a simulation and optimization of a mechanical Design  of the latch insert using Python.
			\item Wrote a controller in C++ to control the latching mechanism.
			\item  See DOI:10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196534 for more information on the robot.

    {December 2018} {
  I worked in collaboration with University of Pennsylvania and Haverford College to investigate the way Non-Newtonian effects impacted lubrication forces within a fluid.
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Analyzed and tracked mechanics of a sphere moving through a fluid using OpenCV 
                      \end{itemize}

    I worked on https://archivogam.haverford.edu/en/, a website designed to connect persons illegally detained and forcibly disappeared in Guatemala during the Civil War with friends and relatives.
                      \begin{itemize}
                       \item Wrote the front and back end of Home and Images Section of Archivo Gam 
		     \item Implemented a panning zoom feature and a person search feature.
