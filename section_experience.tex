  {Jan 2022}      {Mechatronics Engineer |  Motion Planning and Controls }{ASML}{Wilton,Ct}
  {current} {Currently I work to implement motion planning software onto a 6dof robotic reticle stage. This involves simulating the dynamics of the stage and creating/implementing appropriate algorithms to control the stage.
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Designed, developed, and tested  a software algorithm  that used numerical optimization techniques to optimize motor control 					parameters for reluctance actuators given robotic force data. Data was collected using a HIL (hardware in the loop) approach and analyzed in matlab. The control scheme was implemented in simulink, and the software algorithm was implemented on the machine using a combination of matlab and python.
			\item Refactored a code base designed to simulate the dynamics of a 6 dof robotic reticle stage. Transfered this code base into a modern version 					control system (git) from svn to aid software collaboration and tracking.
			\item Designed, developed, and tested a software algorithm that used the kinematics of a robotic stage to prevent thermal stresses 						from damaging the motors. 
           		\item Lead the development of two new mechatronic tools that will enable automatic testing of electro-
nics,hardware, and control methodologies of a 6 dof robotic reticle stage.
		 	\end{itemize} 
                 }

    {May 2021}     {GRASP Lab | Graduate Student Researcher (Robotics)  }{ University of Pennsylvania}{Pennsylvania}
    {Dec 2021}    {I used a phase change material coupled with a heated insert to create a latching mechanism to add directionality to an origami robot. I then designed and implemented a controller in C++ that ran on a micro controller in real time to control the mechanism .
                      \begin{itemize}
			\item Designed and optimized a nonlinear controller using ILC (Iterative Learning Control) 
			\item wrote a monte carlo application in python to pick design parameters for an origami robot.
			\item Wrote a controller in C++ to control the latching mechanism.
			\item  See DOI:10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196534 for more information on the robot.

    {December 2018}   {Fluid dynamic research | Student Researcher}{Haverford College and University of Pennsylvania}{Pennsylvania}
    {May 2020} {
  I worked in collaboration with University of Pennsylvania and Haverford College to investigate the way Non-Newtonian effects impacted lubrication forces within a fluid.
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item  Used Python to perform data analysis on real word data to determine the dynamics of a complex non-newtonian fluid system.
                         \item Analyzed and tracked mechanics of a sphere moving through a fluid using OpenCV.
                      \end{itemize}

    {December 2016}   {Digital Scholarship | Website designer}{Haverford College}{Pennsylvania}
    {May 2019} {
    I worked on https://archivogam.haverford.edu/en/, a website designed to connect persons illegally detained and forcibly disappeared in Guatemala during the Civil War with friends and relatives.
                      \begin{itemize}
                       \item Wrote the front and back end of Home and Images Section of Archivo Gam using django.
		     \item Implemented a panning zoom feature and a person search feature.
                      \end{itemize}
