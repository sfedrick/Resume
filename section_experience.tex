  {Jan 2022} {
                  Currently I work to implement robotic (Controls, Machine learning, Kinematics, and Computer vision) software and functional changes onto a 6 dof, precision, reticle stage. This involves writing software in matlab, python and C++ for a 6dof reticle stage. I then implement the function onto a fleet of stages within a cross sectoral team. 
			\begin{itemize}
		\item Designed a numerical optimization technique to optimize pretension  values for pull only actuators and to optimize controller parameters using a MIL (machine in the loop) approach .
                       \item Created a motion planning application that utilized multithreading to position the robotic stage into several desired positions  .
		    \item Lead the development of two new mechatronic tools that will enable automatic testing of electronics,hardware, and control methodologies of our reticle stage.
		 \item Designed, developed, and tested a software algorithms to keep motor coils warm while preventing movement of the robot in order to minimize thermal stresses due to bonding layers undergoing a phase transition.
		
 			\end{itemize}

    {May 2021}    {
 I used a phase change material coupled with a heated insert to create a latching mechanism to add directionality to an origami robot. I then designed and implemented a controller in C++ that ran on a micro controller in real time to control the mechanism .
                      \begin{itemize}
			\item Designed and optimized a nonlinear controller using Matlab and Python 
			\item Created a simulation and optimization of a mechanical Design  of the latch insert using Python.
			\item Wrote a controller in C++ to control the latching mechanism.
			\item  See DOI:10.1109/ICRA40945.2020.9196534 for more information on the robot.

    {May 2020}   {Fluid dynamic research | Student Researcher}{Haverford College and University of Pennsylvania}{Pennsylvania}
    {December 2018} {
  I worked in collaboration with University of Pennsylvania and Haverford College to investigate the way Non-Newtonian effects impacted lubrication forces within a fluid.
                      \begin{itemize}
                        \item Analyzed and tracked mechanics of a sphere moving through a fluid using OpenCV 
                        \item Programmed a testing instrument to collect force measurements of a probe being moved at a constant velocity through viscoelastic fluid
                      \end{itemize}

    {December 2016} {
    I worked on https://archivogam.haverford.edu/en/, a website designed to connect persons illegally detained and forcibly disappeared in Guatemala during the Civil War with friends and relatives.
                      \begin{itemize}
                       \item Wrote the front and back end of Home and Images Section of Archivo Gam 
		     \item Implemented a panning zoom feature and a person search feature
                      \end{itemize}
